Udemy RPG Game

This is just my progress while learning how to create a 2D game in Unity from the Udemy course. 
So far we have Assets, and some user settings that have been created. 

This is an ongoing project, but in the end it seems interesting to see this game's completion. 

Thanks for looking!
